## ðŸ“‚ Data Overview

The dataset used in this project is stored in the `data/` directory.  
It consolidates multiple sources commonly used in empirical asset pricing research,  
providing a long-term monthly panel of U.S. market and macroeconomic variables.

### Notes
- The **`Data`** sheet is the primary dataset used for ERP estimation throughout this project.  
- **Risk-free rate** is derived from the 3-month Treasury Bill series (`3m` column).  
- **Equity returns** (`vwret`) represent value-weighted stock market performance.  
- Macroeconomic predictors (`dp`, `10y`, etc.) are used for forward-looking ERP models.  
- All returns are expressed in decimal form (e.g., 0.01 = 1%).
